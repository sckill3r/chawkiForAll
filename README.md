# chawkiForAll Library by sckill3r

chawkiForAll is an Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32 library that simplifies working with various sensors and modules,
including: 

- distance sensors (hc-sr04)
- DHT temperature and humidity sensors (DHT11 / DHT22)
- I2C LCD screens (16x2)
- Wi-Fi connections (ESP8266/ESP32)
- RFID (RC522)
- Firebase (realtimeDatabase)

## Features

- **Distance Sensor:** Measure distances using an ultrasonic sensor.
- **DHT Sensor:** Read temperature and humidity values using DHT11 or DHT22 sensors.
- **I2C LCD Screen:** Display messages on 16x2 I2C LCD screens.
- **Wi-Fi Connection:** Connect to Wi-Fi networks on ESP8266 and ESP32.
- **RFID Reader:** Read RFID cards using the RC522 module.
- **Firebase:** set & get data easly with Firebase RealtimeDatabase

## Installation

1. Download the chawkiForAll library from this repository.
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to `Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library`.
3. Select the downloaded chawkiForAll.zip file.
